# CaptainCore Helm

**Take the helm of your WordPress admin.**

CaptainCore Helm is a WordPress plugin that reimagines the admin experience. It replaces the standard, often cluttered, WordPress admin interface with a streamlined, searchable, and unified command center called the **Quick Menu**. Helm is designed for power users who want to navigate and manage their sites with maximum speed and efficiency.

## A Unified Admin Experience

One of the core problems in WordPress is the disjointed nature of the admin interface. Depending on where you are—the frontend, the backend, the Site Editor, or the Customizer—the available navigation and tools change unpredictably. The standard admin menu disappears, and the top admin bar shifts its contents.

Helm fixes this by providing a **single, consistent interface** that works everywhere. The Quick Menu is always available, giving you access to every part of your site from anywhere.

Here's how Helm compares to the standard WordPress navigation across different areas:

| Area | CaptainCore Helm | WP Admin Top Bar | WP Admin Sidebar |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Frontend** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Backend (wp-admin)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Site Editor** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Block Editor** | ✅ | ✔️  | ✔️ |
| **Customizer** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

\* By default the block editor is in fullscreen mode which doesn't show either of the WP Admin bars.

## Features

  * **Quick Menu Popout:** A searchable, full-screen menu that aggregates all admin navigation links into one place.
  * **Universal Access:** The Quick Menu is available on the frontend, backend, Site Editor, and Customizer.
  * **Streamlined UI:** Hides the default left-hand admin menu and provides a compact, clean top admin bar for a focused workspace.
  * **Live Search:** Instantly find any admin page by typing in the search bar. All menu items and sub-items are indexed.
  * **Keyboard-First Navigation:** Open the Quick Menu with a shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+.` or `⌘⇧.`) and navigate entirely with your keyboard.
  * **Consistent Tooling:** Disables the block editor's fullscreen mode by default to ensure the admin bar and its tools are always visible.
